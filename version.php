 * @description 
 * Connects to Moodle, builds the configuration, discovers SAML status, and handles the login process accordingly.
 * 
 * Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a standard for logging users into applications based 
 * on their session in another context. This has significant advantages over logging in using a 
 * username/password: no need to type in credentials, no need to remember and renew password, no weak 
 * passwords etc.
 * 
 * Most companies already know the identity of users because they are logged into their Active Directory 
 * domain or intranet. It is natural to use this information to log users into other applications as well 
 * such as web-based application, and one of the more elegant ways of doing this by using SAML.
 * 
 * SAML is very powerful and flexible, but the specification can be quite a handful. Now OneLogin is 
 * releasing this SAML toolkit for your Moodle application to enable you to integrate SAML in seconds 
 * instead of months. Weâ€™ve filtered the signal from the noise and come up with a simple setup that will 
 * work for most applications out there.
